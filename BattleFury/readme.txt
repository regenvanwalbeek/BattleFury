Welcome to Battle Fury!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rules:
Use your robot to try to knock your opponents off the arena. You win when all 
your opponents run out of lives. As you take more damage, you will deal 
more damage, making you a deadly player. However, you are also more likely to
get knocked off the edge as you take damage.

When you hit 0%, you enter "Rage Mode", where attacks are super deadly but you
are also very likely to fly off the arena.

Punch Jump Mode?
When enabled, you can infinitely jump by alternating jump and punch attacks.
This was a bug, but my sadistic playtesters enjoyed the game more when I treated
it as a feature. So you can enable punch jump mode in the Options menu if you like.
However, no guarantees on bugs that occur in punch jump mode.

Other notes
If you have problems with the game crashing/hanging whenever a player gets hit,
unplug the controller, quit the game, and try reinstalling the drivers for your 
controller. If that doesn't work, disable Rumble in the Options screen, and the 
game will play fine. As far as I can tell, this is a driver issue and there isn't
anything I can really do about it.
