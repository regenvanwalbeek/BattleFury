        <h3>Hey you! Play my game!</h3>

<p>Congrats on making it to my page on Battle Fury - the greatest fighting game ever made. Okay maybe it's just decent. But since you made it to this page, you clearly have good tastes and should play this game.</p>

<p>This game was created for a game development class taken at Iowa State University. The gameplay is a twist on the old Super Smash Bros formula.</p>

<p>Please excuse the programmer art.</p>

<h3>Download</h3>

<p>Download the game <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12369755/BattleFury.zip">here</a>.  </p>

<p>Alternatively, the source is available in the download links above.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>2-4 Controllers Required.<br>
Min Screen Resolution: 1024x768<br>
OS: Winblows<br>
Hardware: Protip - If your hardware can't run this, you should consider letting go of 1990<br>
Friends (Sorry, no single player)  </p>

<h3>Controls</h3>

<p>Left analog stick - Move<br>
A - Jump<br>
B + Left/Right/Up - Punch Left/Right/Up<br>
B + Down (midair) - Ground Pound<br>
X - Grab, Pick up items<br>
X + Direction - Throw in direction<br>
Y + Left/Right - Fire projectile<br>
Start - Pause Game  </p>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<p>Use your robot to try to knock your opponents off the arena. You win when all your opponents run out of lives. As you take more damage, you will deal more damage, making you a more deadly player. However, you are also more likely to get knocked off the edge as you take damage.</p>

<p>When you hit 0%, you enter "Rage Mode", where attacks are super deadly but you are also very likely to fly off the arena. Use this to your advantage to dish out as much damage as possible when at 0%.</p>

<p>Use random rock drops to do devastating damage to your opponents. Pick up ice cream cones to heal yourself up.</p>

<h3>Punch Jump Mode?</h3>

<p>When enabled, you can infinitely jump by alternating jump and punch attacks. This was a bug, but my  sadistic playtesters enjoyed the game more when I treated it as a feature. So you can enable punch jump  mode in the Options menu if you like. However, no guarantees on bugs that occur in punch jump mode. Also, no guarantees on bugs that occur when not in punch jump mode. Because I'm not the Guarantee Fairy.</p>

<h3>Known "bugs"</h3>

<p>If you have problems with the game crashing/hanging whenever a player gets hit, unplug the controller, quit the game, and try reinstalling the drivers for your controller. If that doesn't work, disable Rumble in the Options screen, and the game will play fine. As far as I can tell, this is a driver issue and there isn't anything I can really do about it. That or it's an issue with the controller not getting enough power to rumble, and you should try a different USB hub. Anyhow, blame Micro$oft on this one.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>Run setup.exe to install from the file available <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12369755/BattleFury.zip">here</a>. To uninstall, choose "BattleFury" in the Control Panel.</p>

<p>Alternatively, build from source if you're pro.</p>
